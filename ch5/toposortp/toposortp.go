// The toposort program prints the nodes of a DAG in topological order.
// Practice 5.10: Modify the topoSort function so that it does not sort the
// keys of the map before visiting them. Instead, it should visit the keys
// in the order they are encountered in the map. This will change the order
// of the output, but it will still be a valid topological sort.
// Practice 5.11: Now the linear algebra teacher has made calculus a prerequisite.
// Improve topSort so that it can detect cycles in the directed graph.
